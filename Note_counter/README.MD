This is a basic program you have to give amount of you're money this program will calculate how many 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1 notes are required to fullfill you're amount of money.

I've used unsigned data type to store large number of value so don't give any negative value as input. if you do then program will throw garbage value on you.

To quite the program type 0 and press enter.

One last thing this program will not work if you give input that you have more taka than world richest man or women XD.
